## 🚀 The Concept

As developers, we are obsessed with keeping our GitHub contribution graph populated. We hate breaking streaks. **LifeGit** applies that same psychological "streak" mechanic to your physical and mental health.

Instead of the standard GitHub Green, LifeGit uses a **Burning Orange** heatmap to represent your daily intensity.

> "You wouldn't leave your main branch unmaintained. Don't do it to your body."

## 🕹 How It Works

Every day, you create a **"Commit"** by logging three core metrics. Instead of lines of code, you are measuring effort on a scale of **1 to 5**:

1.  💪 **Workout:** Did you move your body? (Intensity/Duration)
2.  🥗 **Nutrition:** Did you eat clean? (Quality/Adherence)
3.  📚 **Reading:** Did you expand your mind? (Pages/Time)

## 📊 The Algorithm

The app calculates a **Daily Commit Score** (Total: 0–15) to determine the color intensity of that day's square on your calendar.

$$Score = Workout_{(1-5)} + Nutrition_{(1-5)} + Reading_{(1-5)}$$
